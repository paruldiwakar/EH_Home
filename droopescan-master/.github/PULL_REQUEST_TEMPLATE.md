Thanks for your PR! Much appreciated.

Please make sure that:

* Tests pass. Run `droopescan test` after installing dev dependencies.
* You add a test that verifies that the code you added works. 
* If you are adding support for a new CMS, make sure you implement automatic
  updating. Check out update_api.py and drupal.py for API descriptions and an
  example implementation respectively.
